# CLtoolWatch

Hi there! 

This CLI tool has been created using node and some npm libraries. 
It watches files and directories in a working directory and reports if any changes are made. 
Although, this works just locally. 

Please clone the repo and give it a try. 
Before starting, if you are on a MAC or Linux, I believe you should give permission to the index.js file inside the project folder. Running 'chmod +x index.js' in your terminal should do the trick. 

Then, please run 'npm link' and the project should be linked. 
It should work fine if it is run in MAC or Linux termina, but on Windows, it works with git bash or cmd.

Cheers, 
OA
